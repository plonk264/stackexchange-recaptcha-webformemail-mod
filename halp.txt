notes:

requirements:
webserver (apache, nginx, lighttpd, iis, etc)
php
recaptcha account log into google/gmail, then go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha

mailform.html:
line 4: action="#" needs to be a target, e.g. mail.php (or whatever
  you call it)
line 17: put your (public) key from your recaptcha account where
  SITEKEY is
line 21: alternative way to hide your email address. click on "j..."
  to test it out but also get a link to how to make your own. it's
	an <a href...> so you can use an image as the clickable link, too.

mail.php:
(you may want to change the name as needed (don't forget to change
  mailform.html line 4) ...i'm assuming there are spambots that
	troll the internet looking for commonly named email submission
	scripts)
line 8: put your SUPER SECRET private key from your recaptcha account
  here
line 26: email address where you want the web submissions to go to
  (e.g. your primary or personal or business only email address)
line 27: subject of email that arrives in your client
line 29: email address you want your emails to appear to come from.
  be careful that if you use, say, admin@yourdomain.com (and, for
	example it goes down) and you mess up line 26, you may get some
	infinite loop between the two non existant addresses)
line 30: makes replying to the person easier (as long as they typed
  the correct thing on the website) in your client
